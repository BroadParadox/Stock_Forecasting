# Stock_Forecasting

As financial institutions begin to embrace artificial intelligence, machine learning is increasingly utilized to help make trading decisions. Although there is an abundance of stock data for machine learning models to train on, a high noise to signal ratio and the multitude of factors that affect stock prices are among the several reasons that predicting the market difficult. At the same time, these models don’t need to reach high levels of accuracy because even 70% accuracy can deliver solid returns. One method for predicting stock prices is using a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) for times series forecasting.

We have done the prediction of stock price for TATASTEEL. 
The dataset used here has been taken from [NIFTY 50 Stock Market data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/nifty50-stock-market-data).


While the exact price points from our predicted price weren’t always very close to the actual price, our model did still indicate overall trends such as going up or down. This project teaches us the LSTMs can be somewhat effective in times series forecasting.
